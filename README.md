### Description

This code shows you how to place an own CommandButton into the Titlebar of your program.

Great for special commands in your app.

Easy to implement and a cool thing that will impress your users. Enjoy! AND VOTE FOR ME!

To users of WinNT4 or Win2k: I am sorry I have to tell you that this code won´t work on your system. That might be because NT Technology has got a higher security level and doesn´t allow this program to hook windows.
